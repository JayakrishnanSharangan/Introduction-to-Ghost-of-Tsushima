    <h3>The Way of the Samurai</h3>
    <p>Jin was raised and trained in the ways of the samurai. When the Mongols handily defeat the samurai forces, Jin’s world is shattered. <br> He is faced with the most difficult decision of his life: honor the tradition and customs of his samurai upbringing and maintain a fight he cannot win, or deviate from his samurai path to protect the island and its people by any means necessary. <br> <br>
In his quest to reclaim Tsushima, Jin must seek the guidance and support of old friends and new unlikely allies. <br> He must break away from tradition, become a new kind of warrior, and protect what’s left of his home at all costs.</p>
